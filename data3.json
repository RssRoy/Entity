Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B provide basis for the Reporting Financial Institutions (RFIs) for maintaining and reporting information about the Reportable Accounts. This regime obliges financial institutions (FIs) to perform due diligence procedures and identify individuals that are reportable persons and certain entities in which any individual(s) that is/are reportable person(s) hold controlling interest. CBDT has finalized and released the rules 114F to 114H of the Income Tax Rule, 1962 on August 7, 2015. \n\nTherefore, it is mandatory for Financial Institutions to obtain FATCA / CRS declaration even if there is no US indicia so that due diligence can be carried out and only reportable accounts can be reported to CBDT.",

                    "question": "Closure of account under FATCA",
                    "answer": "As per the IGA entered into between US and India, accounts opened between July 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015 were required to be closed. However, CBDT issued a press release to all financial institutions in India on April 11, 2017, that instead of closure of accounts, financial institutions shall not permit any customer induced transactions w.e.f May 1, 2017 in the accounts opened from July 1, 2014 to August 31, 2015 for which FATCA declaration could not be obtained. Hence, all financial institutions in India were required to mark a total freeze on the accounts.\nHowever, there is no such requirement to close or freeze the account under CRS.\n\nAs india has entered into a Model 1 IGA with US government, the financial isntitutions in India will be guided by the rules/clarifications/guidance issued by CBDT from time to time.",

Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B provide basis for the Reporting Financial Institutions (RFIs) for maintaining and reporting information about the Reportable Accounts. This regime obliges financial institutions (FIs) to perform due diligence procedures and identify individuals that are reportable persons and certain entities in which any individual(s) that is/are reportable person(s) hold controlling interest. The details to be reported includes the Tax Identification Number (TIN) issued to the individual or entity in the country of its tax residence for CRS and US TIn for US persons. Hence, the Bank has finalised the FATCA/CRS declaration alongwith the TIN to comply with the Income Tax Rules, 1962. \n\nCBDT has finalized and released the rules 114F to 114H of the Income Tax Rule, 1962 on August 7, 2015.\n\nFurther following links are provided for your reference.\n\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/treaties/Documents/FATCA-Agreement-India-7-9-2015.pdf\nhttp://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/news/guidance-note-on-fatca-and-crs-may-2016.pdf",

Rules 114F to 114H and Form 61B provide basis for the Reporting Financial Institutions (RFIs) for maintaining and reporting information about the Reportable Accounts. This regime obliges financial institutions (FIs) to perform due diligence procedures and identify individuals that are reportable persons and certain entities in which any individual(s) that is/are reportable person(s) hold controlling interest. CBDT has finalized and released the rules 114F to 114H of the Income Tax Rule, 1962 on August 7, 2015. \n\nTherefore, it is mandatory for Financial Institutions to obtain FATCA / CRS declaration from all account holders irrespective of their residential status and any indicia outside India, so that due diligence can be carried out to identify the reportable accounts under FATCA/CRS.",

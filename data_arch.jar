If no record is fetched in HDDPALL option for printing, HDDPRNT option can be tried.                                                                                                                                           2. If PRINT_USER_ID gets updated and corresponding error message is displayed on screen, that specific user only can print the DD.                                 \n3. If there is any printer issue while printing of DD or user fails to acknowledge after proper printing of DD, then the respective inventory gets automatically move to DL/CAN location. However it can be moved back from DL/CAN to ZZ/EXT to DL/DL1 to Employee Location through HIMC option so that printing can be reinitiated on the respective inventory or white sheet as the case may be by the concerned user-id if PRINT_USER_ID is tagged in the system.                                                                                                                                             4. While printing a duplicate DD through HDDRPRNT, there is a display message \"Duplicate DD issued\" in red which is only for information and not an error message.                                                                                                                        5. When duplicate DD is printed, 'Print Advice flg' should always be N. Otherwise inventory number will not be visible while printing may go through.                                                                                                                                           6. For duplicate DD printing, the details of original DD only need to be entered along with Tran-id & Part-tran-srl-num.                                                           \n7. Inability for printing a DD that is issued in a merged entity where there is no inventory maintenance, then HDDT option needs to be enabled with proper approval from application team to transfer the respective amount directly from DD.CENPAY a/c amount directly from DD.CENPAY a/c."

                    "question": "How to use ICIVAM menu option in I-core to map teller and vault accounts?",
                    "answer": "1. BM / DBM can map an employee with any vault account or teller account irrespective of whether the employee is presently mapped to a Vault or teller account.\n2. An employee can be mapped with Vault account only if the employee has cash verification powers.\n3. System will allow change of mapping of a teller account only if balance in teller a/c is zero.\n4. At any given point an employee can be mapped only to a single account, either Vault a/c or Teller a/c. Thus, if an employee is mapped to an A/c (Vault/Teller) and same employee is being mapped with another account, the earlier mapping is de-mapped.\n5. While mapping please note : - If the employee id is 102235,then the input would be 102235; If the vault account is ‘0004CSMAIN01’, the input should be CSMAIN01 in Vault A/c RefCode;If the vault account is ‘0004CSTELL01’ the input should be CSTELL1 in Vault A/c RefCode.\n6. \"\" Add\"\" option in ICIVAM is used to map an employee who is not already mapped either to vault or teller account and \"\"Modify\"\" to change the mapping of an employee from the existing mapping or to de-map the existing mapping.\n\nBefore mapping any teller to branch user, BM/DBM has to check the current available tellers position by invoking the HTCPIAC menu option. From the available BM/DBM has to select one.\n\nPlease Note: In case the teller  account which you want to map  is already mapped to any other user and if that user not there in that sol id then de-mapping can not be done from branch end. BM/DBM has to mark a mail to DPC team to get it de-mapped. Once it is de-mapped branch DBM/BM can map the teller to the other branch user",

However it can be moved back from DL/CAN to ZZ/EXT to DL/DL1 to Employee Location through HIMC option so that printing can be reinitiated on the respective inventory or white sheet as the case may be by the concerned user-id if PRINT_USER_ID is tagged in the system.  \n4.

When duplicate DD is printed, 'Print Advice flg' should always be N. Otherwise inventory number will not be visible while printing may go through. \n6.
